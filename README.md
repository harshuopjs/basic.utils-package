### basic.utils-package
It is my custom basic.util package for array and linkedlist combined together for java 


# Benifits of this package
You can directly use array and linkedlist and perform their actions like insertion deletion and much more without any problem
To use the code u need *caller.java*, *array.java* and *linkedlist.java* 
just compile all of three and run *caller.java*

# Steps to Complie and run 

1. `git clone https://github.com/harshuopjs/basic.utils-package`
2. Go to folder of basic.utils-package in your terminal
3. Now type `java caller`
4. If an error pops like
